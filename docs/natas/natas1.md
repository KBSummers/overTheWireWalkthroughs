## Goal
Understand you dont need right click to see source code

## Walkthrough
Visit the page at https://natas1.natas.labs.overthewire.org. Enter the username:password obtained from last level, and the page should hint that the password for the next level is on this page somewhere, but right-clicking has been blocked. You can use `ctrl+Shift+J` to get to dev tools without having to right click, and obtain the password the same way as we did in the last level.
