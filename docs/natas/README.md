# Natas Walkthroughs

Natas focuses on web security basics: information disclosure, input/encoding quirks, authentication/authorization issues, and simple web exploitation techniques.

---

## Goals
- Learn web fundamentals in small, focused levels.
- Practice: HTML/source inspection, directory enumeration, HTTP requests and responses, cookie/session manipulation, encoding/decoding.

---

## Files in this folder
- `README.md` — this file
- `natas0.md`, `natas1.md`, `natas2.md`, ... — individual writeups
- Optionally: images used by writeups in the `images` directory in the root folder

---

## Writeup format (consistent across levels)
Start each level with these headings so pages are uniform and easy to scan:

# Natas X
## Goal
One-line description of what the level asks you to do.

## Walkthrough
Step-by-step explanation with the commands or HTTP requests used, why they work, and any important observations.

## Key Takeaways
Short bullets summarizing the concept(s) learned.

## Password
The flag/password (clearly marked).

**Reminder:** Keep explanations clear, avoid leaking extraneous credentials, and maintain the educational disclaimer.
