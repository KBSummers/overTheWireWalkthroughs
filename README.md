# OverTheWire Walkthroughs

This repository contains my personal walkthroughs for the [OverTheWire wargames](https://overthewire.org/wargames/), starting with **Natas** and **Bandit**. The goal is to document solutions, capture key takeaways, and keep an organized knowledge base that can later be published as a static site.

⚠️ **Disclaimer**  
All content is for **educational purposes only**. Do not attempt these techniques outside authorized environments.
